# EHU Chatbot Dissertation Script
Originally created in May 2021, this repository is a host of my original dissertation program to create a support chatbot for Edgehill university. The original repository has been archived due to submission format for the university, this acts as a duplicate for ease of accessibility and showcase in my portfolio. 

Project used Tensorflow Keras to provide a chatbot system intended to be integrated with Facebook messenger. The system model used Seq2Seq and was trained on SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) in conjunction with a domain specific dataset made for EHU (in 2021).

This repository has only been uploaded for use in a portfolio showcase. The model and script have been surpassed in recent years since this dissertation had been completed therefore making them incredibly outdated.
